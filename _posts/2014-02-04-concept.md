> Having researched the impact of cities on mental health and well being, we have decided to explore the possibility of creating shared experiences with both friends and strangers in day to day life. This is being done by developing “Street Escapes”: interactive or unusual streetscapes that encourage discussion, thought and play. We are focussing in particular on the area surrounding the Ramboll London office and are integrating the concepts we have into the construction phases of inner-city projects to improve safety and relations with the public.
